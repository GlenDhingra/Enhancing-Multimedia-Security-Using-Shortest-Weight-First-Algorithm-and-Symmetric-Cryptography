# Enhancing Multimedia Security Using Shortest Weight First Algorithm and Symmetric Cryptography


## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing multimedia security through a novel approach. I have developed a unique image encryption method using the Shortest Weight First algorithm, a concept from graph theory, implemented using Python. The objective was to improve multimedia data protection through advanced encryption techniques, offering a higher level of security.

## Key Achievements

### Innovative Image Encryption

I introduced an innovative image encryption approach that leverages the Shortest Weight First algorithm. This novel technique brings together elements from graph theory to improve multimedia data security.

### Python Implementation

The image encryption method is fully implemented in Python, a widely-used and versatile programming language.
